## 200 - Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses

Cloud servers do not have a public network interface unless at least one Primary IP is assigned to them. 

Both resources can be managed independently. 

- This means that it is possible to create Primary IPs without assigning them to a cloud server. 
- And you can create cloud servers with or without assigning public IP addresses (Primary IPs) to them.

Hetzner does not charge for their Primary IPv6s, up to 1 Primary IPv6 per server.
